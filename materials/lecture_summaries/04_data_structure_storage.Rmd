# Recap


## Computers and text
How can a computer understand text if it only understands `0`s and `1`s?

- *Standards* define how `0`s and `1`s correspond to specific letters/characters of different human languages.
- These standards are usually called *character encodings*.
- Coded character sets that map unique numbers (in the end in binary coded values) to each character in the set.
- For example, ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange).

```{r ascii, echo=FALSE, out.width = "30%", fig.align='center', fig.cap='ASCII logo. (public domain).', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/ascii.gif")
```




# Computer Code and Data Storage

## Computer code

  - Instructions to a computer, in a language it understands... (R).
  - Code is written to *text files*.
  - Text is 'translated' into 0s and 1s which the CPU can process.

## Data storage

- Data usually stored in *text files*

  - Read data from text files: data import.
  - Write data to text files: data export.



## Unstructured data in text files

- Store `Hello World!` in `helloworld.txt`.
  - Allocation of a block of computer memory containing `Hello World!`.
  - Simply a sequence of `0`s and `1`s...
  - `.txt` indicates to the operating system which program to use when opening this file.
- Encoding and format tell the computer how to interpret the `0`s and `1`s.


## Inspect a text file

You can use the terminal in RStudio (on Nuvolos) to inspect a text file. Via `cat` you can display the content of a text file interpreted as text (using the system's standard encoding).

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat helloworld.txt; echo
```

```{bash echo=FALSE}
cat ../../data/helloworld.txt; echo
```

Or, from the R-console:
```{R eval=FALSE}
system("cat helloworld.txt")
```


With another application called `xxd`, you can directly look at the `0`s and `1`s stored in a file.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
xxd -b helloworld.txt
```

```{bash echo = FALSE}
xxd -b ../../data/helloworld.txt
```





## Encoding issues

If there is a mismatch between the encoding in which a file was created and the encoding used to look at the file, you will likely encounter some unexpected symbols in the middle of the text. Consider the following example:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cat hastamanana.txt; echo
```

```
## Hasta Ma?ana!
```

Likely, this text file has not been created with the same character encoding as the one used by your system to interpret the underlying 0s and 1s.

```{bash eval = FALSE}
file -b hastamanana.txt
```


```{bash echo = FALSE}
file -b ../../data/hastamanana.txt
```


## Use the correct encoding

Read the file again, this time with the correct encoding

<style>
.lit {
  color: white;
}
</style>

```{eval = FALSE}
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 hastamanana.txt | cat
```

```{bash echo = FALSE}
iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 ../../data/hastamanana.txt | cat
```


## UTF encodings
  - 'Universal' standards.
  - Contain broad variety of symbols (various languages).
  - Less problems with newer data sources...


## Take-away message
  - *Recognize an encoding issue when it occurs!*
  - Problem occurs right at the beginning of the *data pipeline*!
    - Rest of pipeline affected...
    - ... cleaning of data fails ...
    - ... analysis suffers.



## Structured Data Formats

  - Still text files, but with standardized *structure*.
  - *Special characters* define the structure.
  - More complex *syntax*, more complex structures can be represented...

## Table-like formats

Example `ch_gdp.csv`. 

```{}
year,gdp_chfb
1980,184
1985,244
1990,331
1995,374
2000,422
2005,464
```

<center>
*What is the structure?*
</center>

## Table-like formats

- What is the reocurring pattern? 
  - Special character `,`
  - New lines
- Table is visible from structure in raw text file...

*How can we instruct a computer to read this text as a table?*

## A simple parser algorithm

  1.  Start with an empty table consisting of one cell (1 row/column).
  2.  While the end of the input file is not yet reached, do the following:

## CSVs and fixed-width format

  - *'Comma-Separated Values'* (therefore `.csv`)
    - commas separate values
    - new lines separate rows/observations
    - (many related formats with other separators)
  - Instructions of how to read a `.csv`-file: *CSV parser*.

## CSVs and fixed-width format

  - Common format to store and transfer data.
    - Very common in a data analysis context.
  - Natural format/structure when the dataset can be thought of as a table.

<!-- - Let's investigate! -->


## End-of-line characters

```{bash eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
xxd ch_gdp.csv
```

```{bash echo = FALSE}
xxd ../../data/ch_gdp.csv
```


## End-of-line characters

```{bash eval = FALSE, purl=FALSE}
xxd ch_gdp.csv
```

```{bash echo = FALSE}
xxd ../../data/ch_gdp.csv
```

 - `.` (`0d`): indicates end of line! 

## Related formats
 
 - Other delimiters (`;`, tabs, etc.)
 - Fixed (column) width

## More complex formats
  - N-dimensional data
  - Nested data
  - *XML*, *JSON*, *YAML*, etc.
    - Often encountered online!

# Units of Information/Data Storage

## Bit, Byte

  - Smallest unit (a `0` or a `1`): *bit* (from *bi*nary dig*it*; abbrev. 'b').
  - *Byte* (1 byte = 8 bits; abbrev. 'B')
    - For example, `10001011` (`139`)






```{r bitbyteword, echo=FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/bitbyte.jpg")
```

## Bigger units for storage capacity 

 - $1 \text{ kilobyte (KB)} = 1000^{1} \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ megabyte (MB)} = 1000^{2} \text{ bytes}$
 - $1 \text{ gigabyte (GB)} = 1000^{3} \text{ bytes}$
 






# Data Structures and Data Types in R

## Structures to work with...

- Data structures for storage on hard drive (e.g., csv).
- Representation of data in RAM (e.g. as an R-object)?
  - What is the representation of the 'structure' once the data is parsed (read into RAM)?


## Structures to work with (in R)

We distinguish two basic characteristics:

  1. Data **types**: integers; real numbers ('numeric values', floating point numbers); text ('string', 'character values').
  2. Basic **data structures** in RAM:
      - *Vectors*
      - *Factors*
      - *Arrays/Matrices*
      - *Lists*
      - *Data frames* (very `R`-specific)


## Data types: numeric

```{r}
a <- 1.5
b <- 3
```

R interprets this data as type `double` (class 'numeric'):

```{r}
typeof(a)
class(a)
```


Given that these bytes of data are interpreted as numeric, we can use operators (here: math operators) that can work with such functions:

```{r}
a + b
```



## Data types: character


```{r}
a <- "1.5"
b <- "3"
```

```{r}
typeof(a)
class(a)
```


## Data types: character

With data type character, R interprets the values as text. Consequently, the same line of code as above will result in an error:

```{r error=TRUE}
a + b
```



## Data structures: vectors

```{r numvec, echo=FALSE, out.width = "5%", fig.align='center',purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/numvec.png")
```

Examples in R: initiate a character vector and an integer vector with three elements (vectors of "length" 3).

```{r}
persons <- c("Andy", "Brian", "Claire")
persons
```

```{r}
ages <- c(24, 50, 30)
ages
```


## Data structures: factors

```{r factor, echo=FALSE, out.width = "5%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/factor.png")
```


Example in R: initiate a factor variable based on a character vector. 

```{r}
gender <- factor(c("Male", "Male", "Female"))
gender
```

What is the difference between this definition as a factor and the simple definition as a character vector? Factors are typically used to work with categorical variables. Under the hood, R stores the labels of each category (here: `"Male"` or `"Female"`), and then refers to factor elements via category ids. This makes the storage and filtering/access of categorical variables much more efficient (in particular, if there are very long/complex category names/labels contained in the data). Many of the high-level functions you will work with later in the course (e.g. to visualize data) expect you to define categorical variables in a dataset explicitly with factors. 

## Data structures: matrices

```{r matrix, echo=FALSE, out.width = "10%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/matrix.png")
```

Example in R: initialize a matrix with three rows and two columns.

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6), nrow = 3)
my_matrix

```

From the code example we see that R considers matrices essentially as two-dimensional vectors. We first initiate a vector and then define in how many rows/columns this vector of values should be organized. Importantly, like vectors, matrices can only contain values of the same data type.

## Data structures: arrays


```{r array, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/array.jpg")
```

Example in R: initialize a three-dimensional array.


```{r}
my_array <- array(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8), dim = c(2,2,2))
my_array

```

Arrays in R are very similar to matrices. Essentially, they just allow us to store data in more than two dimensions (via the `dim`-parameter). Importantly, like vectors/matrices, arrays can only contain values of the same data type.


## Data frames, tibbles, and data tables
 

```{r df, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/dataframe.jpg")
```


Example in R: initiate a data frame with the three columns "person", "age", and "gender".

```{r}
df <- data.frame(person = persons, age = ages, gender = gender)
df

```

Data frames/tibbles are the typical object class to store entire datasets for data analytics purposes in R. Columns of a data frames can contain vectors of different data types. However, each of the columns must contain the same number of elements. In a data analytics context, we often refer to the columns as the "variables" in a dataset and the rows as the "observations" of a data set. Variables describe the characteristics of the observations.

## Data structures: lists


```{r list, echo=FALSE, out.width = "20%", fig.align='center', purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../../img/list.jpg")
```


Example in R: initiate a list containing an array, a matrix, and a data frame.

```{r}
my_list <- list(my_array, my_matrix, df)
my_list
```

Lists are the most flexible general object class in R to store data. Each element of a list can contain different types of objects/data, and the length of each element can differ.
